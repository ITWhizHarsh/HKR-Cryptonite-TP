# Third Dojo - Comprehending Commands

In this dojo, I learned the following concepts related to symbolic links:

1. **Hard Links**: Multiple names for the same file that point directly to the data.
2. **Symbolic Links (Symlinks)**: References to the original file’s path, like a shortcut.
3. **Creating Symlinks**: Using the command `ln -s [target_file] [link_name]`.
4. **Identifying Symlinks**: Using the `file` command to check file types.
5. **Symlink Behavior**: Accessing a symlink fetches the original file’s content.
6. **Permission Issues**: Understanding how permissions can affect access to files.
7. **Navigating the File System**: Using `cd` and `ls` commands to explore directories.
8. **Manipulating Files**: Creating and managing symlinks effectively.
9. **Practical Applications**: Redirecting access to files through symlinks in challenges.
